## Continuous Tasks
Continuous tasks are used to represent operations that can continue indefinitely but do not have a defined condition for when they should stop. Actions such as spinning a wheel at a given velocity or continuously shooting balls can be represented by a continuous event. The largest difference between continuous and finite tasks is that continuous tasks cannot be sequenced, since there is no definite point where a continuous task ends.
